* [Microsoft / llvm](https://github.com/Microsoft/llvm):Fork of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure
* [earl / llvm-mirror](https://github.com/earl/llvm-mirror):NOTE: The LLVM project now operates official Git mirrors as well: http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#git-mirror -- An automated mirror of llvm/trunk from LLVM's SVN. Updates hourly. Release branches and tags are tracked manually. This mirror is *not* commit-ID compatible with the official Git mirrors.
* [biometrics / likely](https://github.com/biometrics/likely):A compiler intermediate representation for image recognition and heterogeneous computing.

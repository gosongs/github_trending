* [frkunz / stELMOD](https://github.com/frkunz/stELMOD):stELMOD is a stochastic optimization model to analyze the impact of uncertain wind generation on the dayahead and intraday electricity markets as well as network congestion management. The consecutive clearing of the electricity markets is incorporated by a rolling planning procedure resembling the market process of most European markets.
